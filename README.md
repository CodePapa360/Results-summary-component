Just completed the Results [Results summary component challenge from Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV) using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript to add a dark mode toggle feature. This project was a great way to improve my front-end development skills and build a responsive web page with interactivity. Excited to continue using what I've learned in future projects!
